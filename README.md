## Overview

This project provides a robust and scalable framework for automating various tasks within the **Gmail ecosystem** using Python. Leveraging the official Google Gmail API, this solution is designed for reliability and performance. It adheres to best practices in software engineering, including modular design, comprehensive error handling, and secure credential management. This tool is ideal for developers and organizations looking to programmatically interact with Gmail for tasks such as email parsing, data extraction, automated responses, and advanced inbox management.

## Features

- **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Securely authenticates with the Gmail API using a standard OAuth 2.0 flow, handling token refresh and storage automatically
- **Email Reading and Parsing**: Fetches emails, parses their content (plain text, HTML), and extracts key information like sender, subject, and body
- **Message Management**: Provides functionalities to mark emails as read/unread, archive, delete, and apply labels
- **Email Sending**: Constructs and sends emails, including support for attachments and various formatting options
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage API rate limits, authentication issues, and other common failures
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is organized into logical modules, making it easy to extend and integrate with other systems

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to have the following:

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project**: A GCP project with the Gmail API enabled
- **OAuth 2.0 Credentials**: A `credentials.json` file downloaded from the GCP console, configured for a "Desktop app" or "Web application" OAuth client ID
- **`pipenv` (Recommended)**: For managing project dependencies and virtual environments

-----

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wand3/Gmail-API-Automations.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```

## Usage
This project includes a main entry point for running various automation tasks. The first time you run a script, a web browser will open, prompting you to authorize access to your Gmail account. After successful authorization, a token.json file will be created to store the access token, allowing for seamless authentication on subsequent runs.
